## Git Stuff:
- Files can be added by using the add/create file. Commit (put it into the repository) it after

Collaboration Stuff
- Every time you work on the code (esp with other people), create a new branch (version). Upload all files you have changed into that branch. You can choose which branch to work on.
- To put the changes into the main branch (main code), you have to submit a pull request. Just follow the steps until it does an "automatic merge attempt"
  - If there's conflicts (main and branch have different changes/code), you will have to manually change it

- For clarity, it is best to put comments on every commit and merge
